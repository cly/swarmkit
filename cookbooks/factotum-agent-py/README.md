# Factotum Agent (Python)

An interactive chat with a sandboxed AI agent that can think, execute code, browse the web, read / edit files, and solve complex tasks.
Ask for anything—any files the agent creates are automatically downloaded to your local `output/` folder.

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

## Run

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python factotum.py
```

Ask anything and check the traces at https://dashboard.swarmlink.ai/traces. Type `/quit` to exit.

## What it does

- Multi-turn conversation with a sandboxed AI agent
- Agent can write code, create files, browse the web (with EXA)
- Output files are saved to `output/`
